# Risk Management System  
A PySide6 + pandas + Broker APIs tool to view, filter, and analyze trading positions in real-time.  

This project is part of my journey to build financial tools and systems.  
It helps traders analyze and track positions in Indian markets without relying on manual Excel workflows.  

## Why I need to build this  

**Current situation in our organisation**  
- We are 30+ traders, across different broker IDs (Zerodha, IIFL, etc.).  
- After market close, we compile all positions from all brokers into Excel.  
- Managers and owners then use these sheets for risk management and hedging decisions.  
- This requires 20+ back-office staff, often working until **10 PM or even midnight**.  
- Mistakes are frequent because of **manual data entry**.  

 **In short: we are stuck in Excel, and we need automation.**
